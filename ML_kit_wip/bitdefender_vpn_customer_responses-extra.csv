I apologise for the delay in replying to your request for my ‘two cents worth’ and I trust that some of what I found today on your website for iPhone owners, may make some of what I submit here, redundant. However, I’ll continue to submit it as this is how we’ve been operating for the last six months.

Bitdefender Total Security has proven to be a very successful ‘must have’ for our 5 devices at home. It has surpassed all previous security software in which I have invested.

I subscribed to your VPN product back in July 21 as I was finding it difficult with the included version in Total Security, too slow to connect as well as the 200mb per device being a bit limited for daily usage. I am not fond of its auto connection function either, where it decides when needed but doesn’t decide the when it’s not needed; hence I tend to make that decision myself and generally use VPN manually. However, I also then tend to forget that it’s turned on too.

In addition, possibly COVID related, Internet speeds are currently poor across the board, even with my Broadband network consistently running at 54mbps. Having VPN operating unnecessary doesn’t help to improve speed issues?

iOS Devices are an additional concern. With both of our iPhones, the luxury of having Web Protection running continually is just not feasible, as both will exhaust their batteries well short of 24 hours. As a result, I can’t operate in that mode and have no chance at all of convincing my wife to operate with it turned on. So, as above, both of us are using VPN in manual mode, with the added problem of returning to Web Protection when completed. 

I trust my experience may be of use to your team along with the benefit to all those user of Bitdefender products.

Kind Regards

It wasn't until my mobile security expired that I realized I had paid twice for premium VPN services that was running at the same time (if that makes sense?).

Instead the TWO VPNs ran simultaneously.  So to answer the question, I initially believed I needed the VPN service to keep my confidential information private and safe from crooks and untrustworthy individuals, hacking malware, saoftware, etc.  I use Bluetooth often while at work, and like many ppl, use wifi as necessary.  From the very day I began using Bitdefender, it was a personal recovery process for me to trust the use of a mobile device again.  So much so, that I wouldn't sleep with my phone in my bedroom.  I don't know what that means to whoever it is that reads these surveys, but I don't feel safe anymore.  There is a reason people purchase apps and it isn't just to protect banking info.  Some are protecting themselves.","It used to make me feel 100% safe.  I no longer have the mobile security and I will not invest anymore into Bitdefender.  I will continue to use the VPN until my subscription expires.  However, I do believe both the mobile security and VPN work very well together.  I had a heightened sense of comfort, anyway.","I'm finding it hard to name a benefit after the mess I've been through.","None - Bitdefender was my first choice","I had grown to trust the Bitdefender brand over many months of using the mobile protection app.","The app is fine.  I can't compliment a company who can't provide the honesty and mobile security/safety to the loyal customers that it claims to protect 24/7.  An app's software means nothing if the company can honor the same purpose.","0","I'm dissatisfied with the company.   If a company can promise that its product can protect, detect, and offer security from fraudulent activity, said company should do the same or better.  People run companies and develop those apps.  I guarantee they care about their safety, peace of mind, and hard earned money just as I do.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be getting this survey.","no","Yes  (click here to type email address) - Shan.tipton1981@gmail.com"

So they don't get extra to sell any items.","Knowing how the identity theft issues are growing makes me nervous plus I don't like the idea that just anyone can find out where I live or which country, state/province and specific area I reside in, with just one push of a button. It makes me more confident in making online purchases as well, not that I purchase online often but the idea that a VPN is an extra weapon to protect my identity, location, system of payment I use. And that information remains only known between me and the seller. It just puts my mind at ease a little bit more. Don't get me wrong, I'm still nervous about all the concerns I mentioned above, but having a VPN that was so highly recommended from a sales representative that has nothing vested in me buying your specific VPN versus another company VPN did make me confident in purchasing your product.","Anonymity and the fact that your VPN starts when I myself forget to turn it on.","Again, anonymity in knowing that my personal information is more protected.","Nord VPN","I've already answered that question in your previous question on why I chose your product.","User friendly, automated, changes locations by itself within the country I've chosen, I mean it's like it changes locations every so many hours to different states and cities by itself, one minute I'm showing being in Alabama and an hour or so later I am showing to be in Portland Oregon (I really love that function).","9","It's simple, I'm not someone who's computer literate like IT specialist/programmers/code writers/software specialist and hackers of course, though I have become much more knowledgeable through the years and my understanding/knowledge of everything internet related issues is much higher then it was 5 yrs ago and I know exactly what my specific needs are about how I use my computer and the purposes of the software I purchase for my specific needs. For example, a hacker would be wasting his time trying to get my information as I don't have much to steal to begin with. I gave you a rating of 9 for two reasons, first your product works better than my previous VPN and second, I don't give out 10's in any rating because that would mean I think it's perfect and nothing in this world is perfect, there's always room for improving and making a product better.

If I'd known this before purchasing Bitdefender, then I wouldn't have bought it as I'm paying for a product I can't use in the VPN offering ..","yes, I also use ...

For that reason I've never really bothered with it.

It's supposed to let you browse in cognito or something like that but I have no need for anything like that, so I've never bothered. I cheekily decided to give it a try when it said, as I've seen before on all other VPN advertisements for other companies, often as adverts on sponsored videos on YouTube, on your own VPN advertisement on your site about watching Netflix content for other countries. So I thought why not, I pay enough for Netflix and rarely feel I get my money's worth for the limited content on there that I want to watch, but that's partly my own fussiness and not necesarily the fault of Netflix.

After trying it with Netflix it didn't seem to work and Netflix would not play content until it was switched off. I later joined Amazon, on which I think it works, but sometimes it also says the same thing. Probably varies on the way I switch it on and refresh the browser page or whatever.

Overall I don't think it's worth the hassle of switching it on and off and changing server location just to watch the occasional bit of content that you normally would not be able to on sites like Netflix, Amazon and others. It's also a bit bad finding a way round the barriers when really you're not supposed to, but even if you do I don't think it's worth the hassle, unless you are somebody who watches these platforms a lot. I watch a few hours a day, but usually in the background while I'm working, and only about twice a week I might watch a movie or something without it being in the background as such.

Overall I don't think the commercial VPN that I have from Bitdefender or the ones sold by other vendors is worth it. I will probably keep it just to support Bitdefender if I'm in a financail position to do so. I feel if all these other companies are selling it in the millions then why not Bitdefender as well.

What would be really useful is a VPN that when hackers hack your PC they get access only to the dummy VPN and are unable to access any part of your actual PC. Better still if the VPN presents a dummy version of your PC, with a reduced folder structure size, and folder names that have changed, with files that have dummy content. The file content can be generated when the hacker tries to open a file. Just something on these lines which makes the hacker think he is hacking the user's PC but in actual fact he is not.

Hope that helps. You can contact me further opinions on my email account at javedh2 at aol dot com.","I rarely use it. I normally have it turned if off. I does sometimes suggest turning it on when I access a site where a payment might be made, and in those case I sometimes turn it on, at other times I don't bother. I normally only purchase from sites I know, and often larger companies, but the auto-suggestion is still appreciated in the event I'm purchasing from a site I don't normally purchase from. I've also stopped bothering to use it with Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, after the first few times. So that's not an issue for me either.","None really, as I don't really use. I don't believe it actually offers you any benefit whatsoever, but that's not a criticism of ""your"" VPN but of all VPNs I don't think they're useful for anything other than allowing (sometimes and on some platforms) to get round barriers to watch content, such as movies, on servers outside your own server area, such as US instead of Europe, for example.","None - Bitdefender was my first choice","Mostly just to support Bitdefender the company as it's only fair that Bitdefender's parent company also get a slice of the VPN market given there seems to be so many other companies offering it, as often seen on advertising campaigns on online video platforms such as YouTube. Partly also to see what the ""get round the barriers for movies you can watch"" on movie platforms was all about and if it was worth the effort, which I decided after a few times accessing content in this way wasn't.","1) ""Okay for minimal extra protection"" for keeping browsing history private, but it doesn't block all avenues of access to browsing history as it is stored in a number of locations on a device, especially on a PC running Windows 10, or any Windows operating system. Also not a big deal hiding browsing history anyway unless you're up to no good.

2) ""Probably adds a little extra protection on sites where you are making a purchase"". I'm just not sure how much extra protection it actually gives you.

3) ""A great product from a great company"". Although I'm pessimistic on how all these VPNs are in improving security, I think it's more just a bit of gimmick, and offers a very small amount of extra protection.","10","Probably more because I am happy to support Bitdefender and its ancillary products. As for the actual VPN software it's most likely much better than third party alternatives since Bitdefender is an expert in software security whereas other vendors of VPNs may or may not be. I don't know for sure because I don't know about all the other companies that sell VPNs and what their normal business is.","yes, I also use ...

We cannot cast YouTube videos, etc. to our T.V. while Bitdefender VPN is engaged on either of these items.
